- slide 22: importing packages, dialog box 
- slide 24: arithmetic chart 
- pemdas and using () is the same as always in java
- don't repeat, be efficent 
- data type heirarchy; double, float, long, int (big to small) 
- whe performing arthmeic with diff data types, the biger type is the result

Using Methods, Classes, and Objects

- slide 5: parts of a method, method header

- 'void' doesn't return anything to the method
- 'parseInt' does return some thing: 'integer'

Ch. 3 (cont'd.)
Using Methods, Classes, and Objects

- slide 23: look at table 1-3 page 145 for static vs nonstatic example
- when using nonstatic data, just omit the word 'static'
- slide 25: review this concept... 
- data feilds are ususally set private

- this.
- this()
- static vs non static, table in text

	+ american calendar 
	+ Jan = 0, Feb = 1, Mar = 2, etc... 
- QUIZ
	+ 8.5 x 11" cheat sheet
	+ data types, whent to use main()
	+ static vs instance?
	+ when to parse()


Put on Cheat sheet
	byte: -128 to 127
	short: -32,768 to 32,767
	int: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
	long: fucking long
	float: 1.40129846432481707e-45 to 3.40282346638528860e+38
	double: 4.94065645841246544e-324d to 1.79769313486231570e+308d
	char:  'A'
	boolean: 1,0 T,F

	Instance is a specific Object

Ch. 5 (cont'd)

- slide19: start
- "And" operator "&&" multiple tests, if statements 
	+ use if both conditions are needed to be true
- "Or" operator "||" called "pipes"
	+ use if at least one needs to be true
- diamond are decision points, rectangles are unconditional 
- switch Statements: matching one value, against many 
	+ break; 
	+ default 
- alternate short way;
	testExpression ? trueResult : falseResult;
	//assume a=2, b=3
	smallerNum = (a<b) ? a : b;
- NOT operator "!" , flips true to false, false to true
- AND evaluated before OR
- slide37: "put on cheat sheet"
- slide39: "female 3 traffic tickets" - review the two

- used in every OBJ lang
- UML again, helps visualize inheritance 
- minus and plus signs , private vs public

- this() vs super() & this. super. 
	+ ex in Suite.java
- slide 19
- private vals are private*
- ca't overide methods - kinda confused... they're 'hidden'

ch. 12 File Input and Output

- read this chapter on blackboard, not covered in text
- java.io.*; download file package
- File Obj like, File someData = new File("Data.txt");
- use \\ instead of \ for file paths bc "\" is an escape sequence in java
- methods:
	canRead() - boolean
	canWrite() - boolean
	exists() - boolean
	getName() - String
	getPath() - String
	getParent() - String
	length() - long {returns file size}
	lastModified() - long
- Stream Classes:
	InputStream
	OutputStream
	FileInputStream
	FileOutputStream
	PrintStream
	BufferedInputStream 
- System.in - captures keyboard input in the terminal
- "-1" is "end of file"
- throws exception {error handling, you'll see it in examples, not being tested specifically on it.}

- code is in ch replacement folder on bb
- slide26: avoid hard coding file names
- random access, jumping imedialtly to a file
- RandomAccessFile myFile = new Rand...("\\path", "rw");
	seek() - takes position starting from 0
	read(),write(),close()

Sequential File Processing 

- got handout in class
- end of the night resturant example
- retirieving/jumping to files
- sequential - starting point

Tue, Nov 24
Modularization and Cohesion

- in class handouts
	- has examples of each 
- slides have definitions  
- module is to method
- codesion is a measure of the internal stength of a module
	- how closely related they are
- slide 13: example of exam question
