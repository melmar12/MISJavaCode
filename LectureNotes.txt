	+ static vs instance?
	+ when to parse()


Put on Cheat sheet
	byte: -128 to 127

	int: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

- slide19: start
- "And" operator "&&" multiple tests, if statements 
	+ use if both conditions are needed to be true
- "Or" operator "||" called "pipes"
	+ use if at least one needs to be true
- diamond are decision points, rectangles are unconditional 
- switch Statements: matching one value, against many 
	+ break; 
	+ default 
- alternate short way;
	testExpression ? trueResult : falseResult;
	//assume a=2, b=3
	smallerNum = (a<b) ? a : b;
- NOT operator "!" , flips true to false, false to true
- AND evaluated before OR
- slide37: "put on cheat sheet"
